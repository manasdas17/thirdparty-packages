.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy any Leaf, Group or complete subtree from a PyTables file into another file.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h
Prints a help text.
.TP
.B \-v
Show more information.
.TP
.B \-o
Overwite destination file.
.TP
.BI \-R\ RANGE
Select a RANGE of rows in the form \fIstart,stop,step\fR during the copy of
\fIall\fR the leaves.
.TP
.BI \-\-non\-recursive
Do not do a recursive copy. Default is to do it.
.TP
.BI \-\-dest\-title=title
Title for the new file (if not specified, the source is copied).
.TP
.BI \-\-dont\-copy\-userattrs
Do not copy the user attrs (default is to do it).
.TP
.BI \-\-overwrite\-nodes
Overwrite destination nodes if they exist. Default is not to overwrite
them.
.TP
.BI \-\-complevel=(0-9)
Set a compression level (0 for no compression, which is the default).
.TP
.BI \-\-complib=lib
Set the compression library to be used during the copy. \fIlib\fR can
be set to "zlib", "lzo", "ucl" or "bzip2". Defaults to "zlib".
.TP
.BI \-\-shuffle=(0|1)
Activate or not the shuffling filter (default is active if complevel>0).
.TP
.BI \-\-fletcher32=(0|1)
Whether to activate or not the fletcher32 filter (not active by default).
.TP
.BI  \-\-keep\-source\-filters
Use the original filters in source files. The default is not doing that
if any of \-\-complevel, \-\-complib, \-\-shuffle or \-\-fletcher32
option is specified.
.TP
.BI  \-\-chunkshape=("keep"|"auto"|int|tuple)
Set a chunkshape.  A value of "auto" computes a sensible value for the
chunkshape of the leaves copied.  The default is to "keep" the
original value.
.TP
.BI  \-\-upgrade\-flavors
When repacking PyTables 1.x files, the flavor of leaves will be
unset. With this, such a leaves will be serialized as objects with the
internal flavor ("numpy" for 2.x series).
.TP
.BI  \-\-dont\-regenerate\-old\-indexes
Disable regenerating old indexes. The default is to regenerate old
indexes as they are found.
.TP
.BI  \-\-sortby=column
Do a table copy sorted by the values of \fIcolumn\fR.  This requires
an existing index in \fIcolumn\fR.  For reversing the order, use a
negative value in the \fIstep\fR part of \fIRANGE\fR (see \fI\-R\fR
flag).  Only applies to table objects.
.TP
.BI  \-\-forceCSI
Force the creation of a CSI index in case one is not available for the
\-\-sortby column (this implies the modification of the \fIsource\fR
file).  The default is to not create it.
.TP
.BI  \-\-propindexes
Propagate the indexes existing in original tables.  The default is to
not propagate them.  Only applies to table objects.
