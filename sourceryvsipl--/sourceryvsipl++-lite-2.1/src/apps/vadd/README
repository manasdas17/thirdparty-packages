=============================================================================

This directory contains the implementation of a simple application that
demonstrates some of VSIPL++'s basic facilities for building parallel
programs.

In brief, the application adds two vectors and writes the result in a
third vector.

Run the benchmark or execute other functions by specifying the any one of 
the following commands:

  make		Build the benchmark

  make clean	Remove temporary files.

  make check	Run the benchmark

  make [ NP=np ] [ N=n ] profile
		Use the built-in profiling capabilities of the library
		to investigate application timing.  N defines the length
		of the vectors, default 1024; NP defines the number of
		processors, default 1.
		
Notes

  The makefile is set up to automatically determine the location
  of the installed Sourcery VSIPL++ using 'pkg-config'.  Depending
  on the method of installation, this may just work, or you may
  need to set the value of 'suffix', either in the makefile or
  on the command line, in order to select the desired version
  of the library.  Refer to the makefile and to the Quickstart
  guide for details.
