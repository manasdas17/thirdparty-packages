Sourcery VSIPL++ is available under three separate licenses:

1) Commercial Optimized Implementation

  The entire library is available under the terms of a commercial
  license.  Please contact CodeSourcery (1-888-776-0262 or
  sales@codesourcery.com) for details on obtaining rights to use the
  library under this license.

2) GPL Optimized Implementation

  The entire library is available under the terms of the GNU General Public 
  License, contained in the file LICENSE.GPL.

3) BSD Reference Implementation

  The core parts of the library (listed below) are available under the BSD 
  license, contained in the file LICENSE.BSD.

  When the BSD licensed files are configured with "--enable-ref-impl", the 
  result is the VSIPL++ reference implementation.

  The core library parts available under the BSD license are:

    - autogen.sh
    - configure
    - configure.ac
    - GNUmakefile.in
    - install.sh
    - vsipl++-pc.in
    - src/vsip/*        All files in the src/vsip directory
    - src/vsip/core/    All files in the src/vsip/core hierarchy
    - tests/ref-impl/*  All files in the tests/ref-impl directory

  All remaining files are only available under a commercial license from 
  CodeSourcery or under the GPL.

  For example, and without limitation, the following files are not available 
  under the BSD license and cannot be used with the library when configured 
  as the reference implementation:

    - synopsys.py.in
    - apps              All files in the apps hierarchy.
    - benchmarks        All files in the benchmarks hierarchy.
    - scripts           All files in the scripts hierarchy.
    - scripting         All files in the scripting hierarchy.
    - src/vsip/opt      All files in the src/vsip/opt hierarchy.
    - src/vsip_csl      All files in the src/vsip_csl hierarchy.
    - tests             All files in the tests hierarchy,
                        excluding those in tests/ref-impl.
    - vendor            All files in the vendor hierarchy.
