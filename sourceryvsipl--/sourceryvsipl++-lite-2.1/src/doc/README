Introduction
============

  Manuals for VSIPL++Pro are written using DocBook.  For more
  information about DocBook, see:

    http://www.docbook.org

  The DocBook input is processed with OpenJade to generate documentation
  in both HTML and PDF formats.

Organization
============

  Each manual is placed in its own subdirectory of "doc".  Fragments
  that are common to all manuals are placed in "doc/include".

  Docbook stylesheets are placed directly in "doc".

Conventions
===========

  Pronouns
  --------
   
  The user is referred to as "you".  The first person ("I" or "we") is
  never used; refer to CodeSourcery as "CodeSourcery".
 
  Indentation
  -----------
  
  Nested elements are indented one column from their containing
  elements.

  FIXMEs
  ------

  If you must check in documentation that is incomplete or incorrect,
  please mark the areas that need to be fixed with a <note> whose
  <title> is "FIXME".  For example:

    <note>
     <title>FIXME</title>
     <para>An example is needed here.</para>
    </note>

  Adoping this convention uniformly makes it easier to search for
  places that require fixing.
